❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function's scope or passed as
arguments. This will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior because `a` and `b` are undefined.
* ❌ No error handling is present.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
return "Error: Both arguments must be numbers.";
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, allowing users to pass the numbers they want to add.
* ✔ Added a check to ensure both inputs are numbers, providing an error message if they are not, which enhances the
function's robustness.
* ✔ No external variables are used.
